assign2 licensees are "agencies"

Agencies have people: admins, interpreters, and consumers
Agencies have customers... which are organizations (not people)

agency << user::admins 
agency << user::interpreters
agency << org::customers

Agencies have jobs...
	- created by and admin
	- requested by a requestor (of customer)
	- billable to the requestors customer
	- for a (deaf) consumer
	- utilizing an interpreter
	
Customers (of agencies) have requestors (but there is no requestor object yet) 
the requestor is just stored as text (name, email, phone) in the job

who is the customer user that logs in???
